    HEADER: `Hi, I'm Sidney.`,
    HEADER2:`I recently graduated from Brown University with a degree in Computer Science.
    I'm currently an incoming Private Equity Analyst at Related in New York City.`,
    PRIVATE_EQUITY: `TPG selected me as the only rising undergraduate senior to be a summer analyst for TPG Real Estate Partners.
    At TPG I learned to build dynamic Real Estate LBO models, while I rotated through
    deal teams within multiple asset classes, mainly focusing on studios.`,
    SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING: `At Brown I was tasked with a multitude 
    of difficult, rewarding projects. To name a few, I built a simplified example storage 
    system in Go for a cryptocurrency modeled after Bitcoin's storage system. 
    I've developed a program in C from scratch that reads & executes user commands 
    and maintains a job control system. I've designed and
    trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for scene recognition using Python and
    the TensorFlow system. I've also implemented the ID3 machine learning algorithm in 
    Java to generate a decision tree based on supervised (machine) learning.`,
    ENTREPRENEURSHIP: `In the summer of 2020, I participated in B-Lab, an 8-week summer accelerator 
    for high-impact ventures from Brown University. Our startup was a computer vision technology
    that could be used to detect and reduce waste for restaurants.
    Our approach was two-pronged: (1) to make use of our computer science expertise 
    during the pandemic, learning new skills along the way; and (2) to build something that 
    would have a positive impact on society.`,
    ALOE: `During the pandemic, I felt the urge to work on something that would have a positive impact on society. 
    My best friend and I built an iOS application to serve as a platform for talking about and healing from
    mental health issues. I led the front-end development and built the application from scratch using SwiftUI
    and XCode. We eventually deployed our app on TestFlight and ran a beta test with more than 50 users. 
    Our project imported frameworks for Alamofire, Firebase, and CoreData.`,
    WISE_VENTURES: `At WISE Ventures I learned how to make an impact at an investment firm.
    I Led meetings with prospective early growth stage companies and wrote investment memos for new deals.
    Communicated with portfolio companies for quarterly investor updates,
    and presented portfolio updates and potential prospects to Investment Committee through self-made slide decks`,
    VIKINGS: `At TCO Performance Center, perhaps the best professional athletic training
    facility in the world, I was able live out my dreams and acquire unique insight 
    into the detailed business process of managing a professional sports franchise.
    I analyzed player performance on and off the field and reported analyses to senior management.`,
    ACTIVISION_BLIZZARD: `At Activision, I learned how to effectively
    evaluate a publicly-traded company from top to bottom. As a business and strategy intern, I analyzed SEC filings,
    developed an algorithm to analyze data surrounding competitors, 
    and presented research to the strategy team ultimately providing an analysis on how to profit 
    in an evolving gaming market.`,
    UNINTERRUPTED: `In the summer before graduating from high school, I researched youth sports 
    media content consumption habits by interviewing and surveying potential consumers.`,
